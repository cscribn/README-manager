## How To

* Let's get to know each other personally. Have non-work conversations.
* Put yourself in my shoes. I'll do the same for you.
* Ask for help and offer to help.
* Hit me up for feedback and advice.
* Help me prioritize your time.
* Let's inform each other, early and often.
* If you present a problem, propose a solution.
* Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.
* Sometimes we'll have to disagree but move forward.
* I tend to show very little emotion.
  * If you think I should be nervous but I seem calm, ask me about it.
* We'll rethink and relearn.
* Take risks. Clean up what you mess up.
