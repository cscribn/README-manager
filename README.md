## How To

### Communication

* Ask for help and offer to help.
* Let's inform each other, early and often.
* Close the loop on everything we open.
* If you present a problem, propose a solution.
* I do better with gradual processing than real-time.
  * I might need to get back to you.
* Sometimes we'll have to disagree but move forward.
* I tend to show very little emotion.
  * If you're expecting upset but I seem fine, ask me about it.

### Action

* Put yourself in my shoes. I'll do the same for you.
* Help me prioritize your time.
* Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.
* We'll rethink and relearn.
* Take risks. Clean up what you mess up.

## My Clifton Strengths

* Analytical
  * I search for reasons and causes, and think about all factors.
* Learner
  * The process of learning and continuously improving excites me.
* Individualization
  * I figure out how people who are different can work together productively.
