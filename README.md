## How To

### Communicate

* Let's inform each other, early and often.
* Close the loop on everything we open.
* If you present a problem, propose a solution.
  * Unless it's a must-know/urgent.

### Take Action

* Put yourself in my shoes. I'll do the same for you.
* Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.
* There will be issues that aren't your fault, but are your problem, and we'll face them together.
* I'd rather that you stay aggressive and sometimes miss dates than being conservative and always hit dates.
* Take risks. Clean up what you mess up.
