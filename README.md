## How To

* Let's get to know each other personally. Have non-work conversations.
* Put yourself in my shoes. I'll do the same for you.
* Ask for help and offer to help.
* Hit me up for feedback and advice.
* Help me prioritize your time.
* Let's inform each other, early and often.
* If you present a problem, propose a solution.
* Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.
* Sometimes we'll have to disagree but move forward.
* I tend to show very little emotion (I'm working on this). If your feelings don't match up with my expression, please ask about it so we can get on the same page.
* We'll rethink and relearn.
* Take risks. Clean up what you mess up.

## My Clifton Strengths

* Analytical
  * I search for reasons and causes, and think about all factors.
* Learner
  * The process of learning and continuously improving excites me.
* Individualization
  * I figure out how people who are different can work together productively.
