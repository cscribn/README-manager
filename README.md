## Things I like
For both myself and others.

### Communication

* Informing early and often.
* Closing the loop on everything that is opened.
* Proposing a solution when presenting a problem.

### Taking Action

* Putting one's self in someone else's shoes.
* Doing what you can, where you are, with what you have.
* Helping face issues that aren't one's fault, but are one's problem.
* Staying aggressive and sometimes missing dates rather than being conservative and always hitting dates.
* Taking risks. Cleaning up the messes.
